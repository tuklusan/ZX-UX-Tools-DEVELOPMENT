"""Recognize only the Spectrum 48K ROM single-line scroll entry.

An archived program uses USR 3280 (0x0CD0) to scroll the bitmap. This is
ROM, rather than an arbitrary machine-code address in shared RAM. The memory
review exemption applies to exactly this decimal literal, never an expression
or another USR address. Native execution is still required independently.

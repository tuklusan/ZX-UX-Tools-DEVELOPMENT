"""Keep ZX-UX native PRINT out of the ROM's blocked pagination path.

The original ROM's 'scroll?' message calls WAIT-KEY, which cannot consume
input from the ZX-UX kernel's keyboard interrupt handler.  Save the ROM's
scroll counter for each native PRINT, allow ordinary bitmap scrolling during
that statement, and restore the prior counter afterward.  No BASIC source,
printer operation, kernel storage, or public PEEK/POKE policy is altered.

# rfc program corpus

Included sources must have a permissive licence recorded here.  `reference/`
sources are investigation material only; do not ship code from an entry marked
`reference-only`.

| Program | Upstream URL and pinned revision/checksum | Authors | Licence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F83 calendar | [janaite/forth83-80](https://github.com/janaite/forth83-80) `b7a9d7b028f27451d1f78e954970b420ae136547`, `clock.blk` | F83 contributors | Unlicense / public domain | `ported`: CP/M clock I/O is replaced by explicit date arguments in `portable/calendar.fth`. |
| F83 Huffman | [janaite/forth83-80](https://github.com/janaite/forth83-80) `b7a9d7b028f27451d1f78e954970b420ae136547`, `huffman.blk` | F83 contributors | Unlicense / public domain | `port`: `ported/hufdemo.fth` keeps the bit codec, uses target memory instead of CP/M files, and uses a compact fixed codebook. |
| F83 BASIC | [janaite/forth83-80](https://github.com/janaite/forth83-80) `b7a9d7b028f27451d1f78e954970b420ae136547`, `basic.blk` | F83 contributors | Unlicense / public domain | `research`: retained until vocabularies, immediate words, and a resident interpreter are available. |
| Worms? | [savetz/worms](https://github.com/savetz/worms) `1eed81a91e1a8eee012dd8a01eac431e731367bd` | David S. Maynard / Kay Savetz | MIT | `port`: `ported/worms.fth` retains the movement loop and replaces 6502 display, sound, and keyboard code with a ZX-UX console board. |
| VolksForth samples | [cstrotm/VolksForth](https://github.com/cstrotm/VolksForth) `f4ccb36db7cde41671549e81622a0c2f7a01e26e` | VolksForth contributors | BSD-3-Clause | `research`: inspect each selected file before copying; current tree is platform-oriented. |
| pForth benchmark | [philburk/pforth](https://github.com/philburk/pforth) `e5617638c3a397c644fe82c6301711867a0ca1bf`, `fth/bench.fth` | Phil Burk and contributors | ISC | `adopt`: portable `sum.cells` and `factorial` are in `portable/pfbench.fth`; host timing loops and other ANS-only benchmarks are excluded. |
| pForth sieve | [philburk/pforth](https://github.com/philburk/pforth) `e5617638c3a397c644fe82c6301711867a0ca1bf`, `fth/siev.fth` | Phil Burk and contributors | ISC | `port`: algorithm is in `portable/pfsieve.fth`; the 8190-byte host benchmark table is reduced to 1024 bytes for the ZX-UX arena. |
| F83 numerical-analysis suite | User-supplied `F83_Z80_20_DEMOS.zip`, SHA-256 `E004302C6CD3A3322F1C1FBB40450A25D771CD5F97AF1AB30949EE6C765C655D` | Project owner | Owner-confirmed; standalone notice pending if required | `adopt`: 20 fixed-point numerical-analysis demos are adapted into `numerical-analysis/*.fth`; support words are concatenated because rfc has no `INCLUDE`. |

Every included program has a nearby README stating its source, licence, target
behaviour, and the changes made for rfc.
